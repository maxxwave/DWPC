# DWPC
This code is dedicated to simulate a 1D domain-wall propagation into a nano-strip with two notches or anti-notches wich give power law pinning energy.
The domain wall is driven by an oscillating magnetic field between the notches.
This code is developed by Razvan Ababei in collaboration with Tom Hayward.
